# The Marooned's Folly

This repository contains a Ren'Py visual novel project.

What's included
- game/ - Ren'Py scripts, assets, and localization.
- gui/, audio/, images/ - project assets used by the game.

Notes before publishing
- Do NOT commit large build outputs (use .gitignore).
- Do NOT commit personal secrets or API keys. Check `game/options.rpy` or other files for any hard-coded credentials.

Getting started with Git & GitHub (Windows PowerShell)
1. Install Git if you don't have it: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd "e:\Project-Priates\RenPy\The Marooneds Folly"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

3. Create a new repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new).
4. Add the remote and push (replace URL with your repo):

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you prefer to use the GitHub CLI (gh), you can run:

```powershell
gh repo create <username>/<repo> --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

If you want, I can initialize the repo and make the first commit for you, or walk you through creating the GitHub repo and pushing. What would you like me to do next?

## Collaboration

If you'd like to co-develop with others, here are the basic commands and workflow your collaborators can use to start working with this repository.

Clone the repository (one-time):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
cd "<repo>"
```

Get the latest changes from main:

```powershell
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Create and push a feature branch:

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
# make changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Short description of change"
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>
```

Open a Pull Request on GitHub to merge changes into `main`. Use PRs for review and testing before merging.

If the repository is private, invite collaborators under Settings â†’ Manage access. For very large binary assets, consider Git LFS (ask if you need help setting it up).
